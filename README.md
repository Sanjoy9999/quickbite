## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Backend Architecture (Express.js + Node.js)

**Layered Design Pattern:**
```
Routes → Controllers → Services → Models → Database
```

- **Routes Layer**: Clean RESTful endpoint definitions with middleware chaining
- **Controllers**: HTTP request/response handling and validation
- **Services**: Business logic isolation (e.g., chatbot intelligence, order orchestration)
- **Models**: Mongoose schemas with proper relationships and indexes
- **Middleware**: Authentication guards, error handling, file upload processing

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- 🔐 Session-based authentication for stateful connections
- 🔌 Socket.io for bidirectional real-time communication
- 📦 Service pattern for complex business logic (chatbot, recommendations)
- 🎨 Controller-service separation for testability
- 🗄️ MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible document modeling

### Frontend Architecture (React + Vite)

**Modern React Patterns:**
```
Pages → Components → Hooks → Redux Store
```

- **Pages**: Route-level components with lazy loading potential
- **Components**: Reusable UI pieces (FoodCard, CartItemCard, Chatbot)
- **Custom Hooks**: Data fetching abstraction (useGetCurrentUser, useGetItemByCity)
- **Redux Store**: Centralized state management (user, cart, orders, socket)
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast HMR and optimized production builds

**UX Highlights:**
- 🎨 Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- ⚡ Optimistic UI updates with real-time sync
- 🎭 Custom loader animations (scooter loader for branded experience)
- 🧩 Component composition for maximum reusability

## 🧠 AI & Intelligence Layer

### Conversational Assistant

The platform features a sophisticated chatbot powered by Google Gemini (LangChain/LangGraph):

**Intent Recognition:**
- 🎯 Price-based queries: "show items under ₹150"
- 🔎 Category search: "find chinese food near me"
- 💡 Recommendations: "what should I order based on my history?"
- 🌟 Popular items: "show me trending dishes"
- 👋 Conversational greetings and natural language understanding

**Technical Implementation:**
- **LangGraph State Machine**: Nodes for analyze → search → recommend → respond
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Works with or without AI API (deterministic DB queries as fallback)
- **Context Persistence**: MongoDB/MemorySaver for conversation history
- **Smart Extraction**: Regex + NLP for price ranges, categories, and intents

**Recommendation Engine:**
- Analyzes user's past orders (order history mining)
- Excludes already-ordered items to suggest new experiences
- Considers ratings, popularity, and category preferences
- Falls back to trending items for new users

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Session-based auth with httpOnly cookies
- ✅ Role-based access control (user/owner/admin)
- ✅ Password hashing (bcrypt assumed in production)
- ✅ Protected routes with `isAuth` middleware
- ✅ Owner verification for shop/item operations

### Data Protection
- 🛡️ Input sanitization in controllers
- 🛡️ Mongoose schema validation
- 🛡️ Sensitive data filtering (passwords never returned)
- 🛡️ Environment variables for secrets
- 🛡️ CORS configuration for trusted origins

### Production Hardening Checklist
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS everywhere
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
- [ ] Add request validation (express-validator)
- [ ] Set up API versioning
- [ ] Configure helmet.js for security headers
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging (Winston/Bunyan)
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)

## 📊 Database Design

### Core Models

**User Model:**
- Basic profile (name, email, phone, password)
- Role differentiation (user/owner)
- Location tracking (city, state, address, GeoJSON point)
- Cart items and order history references

**Shop Model:**
- Owner relationship
- Location and operating hours
- Rich metadata (images, description, ratings)
- City-based indexing for fast queries

**Item Model:**
- Shop relationship (populated in queries)
- Category, food type, price, availability
- Images and detailed descriptions
- Rating and review aggregates

**Order Model:**
- User and delivery boy relationships
- Multi-shop order support (nested shopOrders array)
- Status tracking per shop
- Payment and delivery details

**Delivery Assignment Model:**
- Order-to-delivery-boy mapping
- Status and timestamp tracking

### Indexing Strategy
- 🚀 City-based compound indexes for shop/item queries
- 🚀 User ID indexes for fast order lookups
- 🚀 Geospatial indexes for location-based discovery
- 🚀 Text indexes for search functionality (future enhancement)
